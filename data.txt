I woke up on a beautiful morning and sleepy eyes and thought about what I did and didn’t do this year. Although I don’t remember having any goals per se I wrote down at the beginning of the year because I wasn’t all excited coming into 2023. I still had specific things I wanted to achieve. There are so many things that could have gone wrong in the year but God held my hand all through and directed me.
I sit down to write few lessons I learned through the year and how they shaped me.
Although, there are other little lessons I learned along the way, here are five major ones I wanted to highlight.

My name is Ubaydah and although I share on this space my progress in my academics and interests.
